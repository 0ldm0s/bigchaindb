Correctness assertions

Tx output spent only once (across one block or many blocks)
Tx appears only once (across one block or many blocks)
No structurally invalid Tx (schema, policy, sum of inputs == sum of outputs)
No Tx that spends non existing output
All fulfillments must contain signature
All signatures are verified using Tx identity and crypto-condition of output
Threshold and Ed25519 condition is supported (up to some size limit)
All Txes verifiable according to signatures and hash(serialize(tx))
Txes appear in dependency order which is a PARTIAL order
We are able to provide non embarrassing timestamp
